# Lexical Distance Modeling and Clustering in Narrative Texts
This project implements an NLP pipeline for unsupervised word clustering on Project Gutenberg texts. The workflow covers corpus cleaning, POS-based vocabulary selection, distance modelling with global and sentence-local metrics, and graph refinement using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest paths, followed by hierarchical clustering and silhouette evaluation.
